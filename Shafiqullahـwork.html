 <h1>Configure Firewall Rules  <\h1>
 <p>
Finally, it’s time to configure some rules for the Firewall. 
Connections to the FTP server would be banned by standard if you have the integrated firewall turned on throughout Windows 10 unless you specifically enable the service to pass.
 Hence, we will be enabling the service of firewall using the Settings of Firewall. 
Hence, open the Windows Security settings from the search bar of your Windows 10. 
Explore the section of Firewall & Network Protection among all the other services. 
Within the Firewall & Network Protection, click on the blue highlighted line “Allow an app through firewall” stated below in the window.
