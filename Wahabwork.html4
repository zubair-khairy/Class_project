<h1>   How to Setup FTP Server on Windows <\h1>
<p>
Constructing a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server within Windows 10 is among the easiest ways for uploading documents from almost any place to your system without the limits that cloud storage facilities generally impose.
 You’re effectively establishing a private cloud over which you have complete control when using an FTP server. There are no monthly transmission limits, and speeds are unlimited (dependent on the internet contribution).
 You may also send a 1KB text document and a 1TB backup document. You can establish many more profiles as you like to enable relatives and communities to store and exchange data amongst each other. We’ll show you how to set up and administer an FTP server on one PC throughout this Windows 10 tutorial.
